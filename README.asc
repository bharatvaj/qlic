== qlic

qlic is an unecessarily fast cli frontend to the venereal Zoho cliq. It is cliq but unopinionated.

=== Why?

I avoid browsers like the plague. Zoho cliq was my only reason for using a browser. Not anymore.

=== Usage
==== Sending a text

	echo "Hey" | qlic -r client_id
	qlic -r client_id "Hey"

==== Sending an attachment
	cat image.jpg | qlic -r client_id -b image.jpg

=== What works

* Authentication via OAuth
* Receive and send text to chat, channels
* Receive and send attachments to chat, channels

=== What doesn't work

* Cliq call - Apparently this takes more work than I thought.
* Screenshare - Sharing screen is top priority for qlic, but it requires call to work first.
* Widgets - I have no interest in implementing widgets in a cli as it
doesn't benefit me, but contributions are welcome as always.

=== Install

	git clone https://github.com/bharatvaj/qlic
	cd qlic
	make install

=== Dependencies

* libcurl
* bharatvaj/OAuth2
* yarosla/nxjson

=== Setup

Create a config file at $XDG_DATA_HOME/qlic/data.json with the following configuration

	{
	  "user_id": {
	    "client_id": "<zoho_client_id>",
	    "client_secret": "<zoho_client_secret>"
	  }
	}

NOTE: client id and secret can be obtained from https://api-console.zoho.com/
